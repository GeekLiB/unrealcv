The motivation of UnrealCV is making virtual worlds easier to **create, use and share** for computer vision researchers.

If you have an Unreal Engine project, you can compile UnrealCV into your project and share with other researchers. This is different from releasing an image/video dataset. Other researchers can use UnrealCV commands to generate image/video with rich ground truth and do perform many more tasks that are not available for a static dataset.

## How to package

You can use the editor menu to package a game. Many related blog posts can be found online. Or use scripts provided in UnrealCV repository.
