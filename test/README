The development of unrealcv is supported by a set of test to ensure the correctness. To run the test for each components, `cd` to this folder and run `py.test -x`, the `-x` parameter will stop when encounter the first error. Use `py.test -v` if you prefer a verbose output.

1. `client`

Test the correctness of unrealcv client. The test is done with a dummy test server which mimics the function of unrealcv server.

2. `ipc`

Test the connection between the client and the plugin. Test the data exchange, throughput, framerate, etc. No unrealcv commands is involved. Make sure the plugin is stable by itself.

3. `command`

Test the correctness of unrealcv commands. If you implemented a new command, add a test to here. Organize by the hierarchical structure of the unrealcv commands.

Make sure files have been cleared before running the test.
